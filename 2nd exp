To show fcfs and sjf... input BT and arival time, output = average waiting time;

FCFS = will be based on arival time; 
algorithm

get the no.of jobs;
get the arival and burst time of all the jobs;

4 process le liye

wt =0;

at =2 7 4 8

bt =3 1 7 3

fcfs - at sort karo fir jo shortest at wala ho usse compute karo

if(ar > total) {
wt= at - wt;
}
if(x==0) {
total time =0 + at + bt; 
}
else if(at > wt && x!=0 ){
    totaltime = total + bt + (at- total);
}
else {
    totaltime = total + bt
}

wt=0;
